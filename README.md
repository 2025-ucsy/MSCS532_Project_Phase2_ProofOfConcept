# MSCS532 Project Phase 2: Proof of Concept

This repository contains the core implementation and testing for **Phase 2** of the course project:
**"Detecting Influential Users in a Social Network Graph"**

---

## 📌 Objective

To create a partial implementation of a graph-based system that identifies the most influential users in a social network, using Python. This phase focuses on demonstrating core data structure operations and testing.

## 📁 Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `graph.py` | Implements a directed graph using an adjacency list with BFS and DFS traversal |
| `influential_user.py` | Function to find the most influential user based on degree centrality |
| `main.py` | Script to build and traverse the graph, print influence results |
| `test_cases.py` | Separate test script with edge cases and influence testing |
| `main_output results.txt` | Output log from running `main.py` |
| `test_cases output results.txt` | Output log from running `test_cases.py` |

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python main.py
python test_cases.py
